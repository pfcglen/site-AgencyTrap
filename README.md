# site-AgencyTrap - is a dummy site for web development from design to custom HTML.

To whom it may concern,

The site is partially finished, contact page is on development will finished today.
the instruction is to build the site with Angular or React framework, but i made the site with traditional technology HTML, CSSS and Javascript/Jquery
also i used bootstrap and jquery cycle for testimonial section. The site also responsive for max: 480px only.

For the first time i managed to used NPM and GIT here that's also makes the site takes 5 days to finished.
Supposedly it as done but since i am using GIT for the first time and encounter big mistake all my files and folder was missing, i don't know why.
takes time to investigate eventually i retake the blog page and sooner the contact page.

However, i was able to manage to continue my site even though i got big trouble with git.
